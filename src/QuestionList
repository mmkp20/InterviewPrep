Here's a list of live coding interview questions that are commonly asked for a Java software engineer role

1.Reverse a String:
    Write a function that takes a string as input and returns the reverse of that string.

2.Find the Missing Number:
    Given an array containing n distinct numbers taken from 0, 1, 2, ..., n,
    find the one that is missing from the array.

3.Validate Palindrome:
    Write a function to determine if a given string is a palindrome or not.

4.Implement a LinkedList:
    Implement a simple LinkedList class with methods
    to add elements, remove elements, and search for an element.

5.Binary Search:
    Write a function to perform a binary search on a sorted array and
    return the index of a given target element, or -1 if it's not present.

6.Merge Sorted Arrays:
    Given two sorted arrays, merge them into a single sorted array.

7.Find Duplicate Elements:
    Given an array of integers, find all the duplicate elements present in the array.
->O(N^2) , O(N)

8.Implement a Stack:
    Implement a Stack data structure with methods to push, pop, and peek at the top element.

9.Reverse a LinkedList:
    Given a LinkedList, reverse it in-place.

10.Check Balanced Parentheses:
    Write a function to determine if a given string containing parentheses is balanced or not.


------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* for coding interview *
- String and array manipulation : read API about array and string

- Data Structures and Algorithms:
     Be familiar with
     arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, and trees, as well as
     algorithms like sorting, searching, and graph traversal.

- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP):
    Understand the principles of OOP,
    such as encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism.

- System Design:
    Be prepared to discuss and design solutions for scalable and efficient systems.
    Understand concepts such as load balancing, caching, database sharding, and microservices architecture.

- Code Optimization and Performance:
    Showcase your ability to write optimized code and improve the performance of existing code.
    Consider topics like time complexity, space complexity, and algorithmic efficiency.

- Effective Communication and Collaboration:
    During the live coding interview,
    clearly communicate your thought process,
    ask clarifying questions,
    and engage in a collaborative problem-solving approach with the interviewer.

    * Explain your code, discuss trade-offs, and be receptive to feedback.

Remember, it's essential to practice regularly by solving coding problems, reviewing core concepts,
and implementing solutions in Java.
